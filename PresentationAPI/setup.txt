Note, that if you have no such wireless display adapter, but are willing to run the application on your device, Android gives you the option to use a simulated secondary display for testing purposes. This simulated display appears as an overlay on your device screen. To enable it:

 Open the `Settings` app and select `Developer Options`.
 Use the `Simulate Secondary Display` option to select a display to simulate.
